    % abstract = {The improved diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) from electrocardiograms (ECG) may help prevent their severity. Since Deep Learning (DL) became popular, several DL methods have been developed for ECG classification. In this work, we compare how different methods for ECG signal representation perform in the multi-label classification of CVDs, including recent attention-based strategies. Furthermore, multimodal fusion strategies are employed to improve the prediction capacity of individual representation networks. The publicly available PTB-XL ECG dataset, which contains 21,837 records and labels for the diagnosis of 4 CVDs, was used for the task. Two DL strategies using different processing approaches were compared. Recurrent Neural Network-based models take advantage of the temporal dependence between raw signal values, namely through Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and 1D-Convolutional Neural Network models. Additionally, the raw ECG was converted into image representations, based on recent work, and the classification was performed using distinct 2D-Convolutional Neural Networks. The potential of multimodal DL was then studied through early, late and joint data fusion strategies, to evaluate the benefit of resorting to multiple representations. Results based on the 1D ECG representation outperform image-based approaches and multimodal models. The best model, GRU, achieved sensitivity and specificity of 79.67% and 81.04%, respectively.}

    % abstract = {The ubiquity and commoditisation of wearable biosensors (fitness bands) has led to a deluge of personal healthcare data, but with limited analytics typically fed back to the user. The feasibility of feeding back more complex, seemingly unrelated measures to users was investigated, by assessing whether increased levels of stress, anxiety and depression (factors known to affect cardiac function) and general health measures could be accurately predicted using heart rate variability (HRV) data from wrist wearables alone. Levels of stress, anxiety, depression and general health were evaluated from subjective questionnaires completed on a weekly or twice-weekly basis by 652 participants. These scores were then converted into binary levels (either above or below a set threshold) for each health measure and used as tags to train Deep Neural Networks (LSTMs) to classify each health measure using HRV data alone. Three data input types were investigated: time domain, frequency domain and typical HRV measures. For mental health measures, classification accuracies of up to 83% and 73% were achieved, with five and two minute HRV data streams respectively, showing improved predictive capability and potential future wearable use for tracking stress and well-being.}
